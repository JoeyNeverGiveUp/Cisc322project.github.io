<h1>My Favorite Food</h1>
<h2>by Jinyang Chen</h2>
<p> I have many favourite foods. There is so much amazing cuisine in China that you can't imagine.Chinese 
    cuisine is divided into eight major cuisines, among which Shandong cuisine, Sichuan cuisine, Cantonese 
    cuisine, Fujian cuisine, Jiangsu cuisine, Zhejiang cuisine, Hunan cuisine, and Anhui cuisine are called 
    "eight major cuisines".</p>

<p> Each cuisine has different flavors and preparations, and my favorites are Hunan and Sichuan dishes because
     they are very spicy. I like spicy!
